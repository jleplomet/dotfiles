# dotfiles
My dotfiles for Mac OS X

# Installs
- ``rvm``
- `` ruby, gems: sass, compass``
- ``nvm``
- ``node, packages: gulp, grunt-cli``

# Overview
- Updates ``.bash_profile`` to initiate nvm, and rvm so you dont have to :-)
- Updates ``.bash_prompt`` to look cool
- Includes ``.exta`` so you can manage your ``PATH`` easily.
- Includes ``.functions`` some neat stuff is in there
- Includes ``.aliases`` create aliases to folders
